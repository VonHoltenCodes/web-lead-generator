# Web Lead Generator

A system to identify local businesses without websites and manage outreach campaigns.

## Overview

This tool scrapes Google Business Profiles to find businesses without websites, stores their contact information, and provides an interface for managing outreach calls.

## Current Status

âœ… **Completed:**
- Database schema designed and implemented (PostgreSQL)
- Two scraper versions:
  - V1: Basic scraper (limited phone extraction)
  - V2: Click-for-details scraper (successful phone extraction)
- Phone number extraction working reliably in V2
- Three scraping modes: test, full, debug
- Polite scraping with anti-detection measures
- Respects server resources (3-5 sec delays, 2-3 min breaks)

ðŸš§ **Known Issues:**
- Website detection showing same URL for all businesses (markson59.com)
- GBP URLs getting duplicated causing only 1 business to save per run
- Need better unique business tracking

ðŸ“‹ **Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Fix website detection logic in V2 scraper
2. Ensure unique GBP URLs per business
3. Create CSV export functionality
4. Build basic call tracking interface
5. Address legal compliance for calling

## Target Area
