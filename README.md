# Web Lead Generator

A system to identify local businesses without websites and manage outreach campaigns.

## Overview

This tool scrapes Google Business Profiles to find businesses without websites, stores their contact information, and provides an interface for managing outreach calls.

## Current Status

âœ… **Completed:**
- Database schema designed and implemented (PostgreSQL)
- Two scraper versions:
  - V1: Basic scraper (limited phone extraction)
  - V2: Click-for-details scraper (successful phone extraction)
- Phone number extraction working reliably in V2
- Three scraping modes: test, full, debug
- Polite scraping with anti-detection measures
- Respects server resources (3-5 sec delays, 2-3 min breaks)
- Industry-specific scrapers (restaurant and general business)
- Pagination support (up to 5 pages/100 results)
- Memory management via browser restarts every 50 businesses
- **NEW: Incremental saving to prevent data loss on timeouts**

ðŸš§ **Known Issues (Fixed):**
- ~~Timeout causing complete data loss~~ - Fixed with incremental saving
- ~~Memory overflow after ~60 businesses~~ - Fixed with browser restart logic

ðŸš§ **Current Known Issues:**
- General business scraper sometimes shows duplicate phone numbers across businesses
- Some businesses may have incomplete address extraction
- Website detection could be improved for businesses with complex menu structures

ðŸ“‹ **Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Improve phone number deduplication logic
2. Build basic call tracking interface (Next.js)
3. Implement TCPA compliance for B2B calling
4. Add phone number validation
5. Create automated scheduling for regular scrapes

## Target Area
